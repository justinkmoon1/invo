This is a repository for the code used for the 2023 Wharton Global High School Investment Competition.

In the _models_ directory, there are several samples for the LSTM model that we are planning to use in stock price prediction

We have also prepared various programs in the _tools_ directory to help in gathering finance data and processing them for analysis.

To install the dependencies necessary for the repository, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
