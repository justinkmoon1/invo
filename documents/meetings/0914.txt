simply makes a lot of models and then uses them to calculate the confidence interval

bootstrap method for calculation of confidence interval (paper)

reference: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/confidence-level-versus-confidence-interval
Calculation of the confidence level:
1. Gather the sample size information
2. Find half the size of the confidence interval
3. Multiply by the square root of the sample size
4. Divide by the sample standard deviation


Summary: find confidence interval using bootstrap/brute force -> use them to describe results
Put the confidence level from the confidence interval into the Black Litterman Model
